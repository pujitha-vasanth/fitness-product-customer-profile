# Fitness Product  - Customer Profile Analytics 
## Context
The market research team at AdRight is assigned the task to identify the profile of the typical customer for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. Being a part of the market research team, we decide to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. We collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGood Fitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file.

## Goal
Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each CardioGood Fitness treadmill product line.
